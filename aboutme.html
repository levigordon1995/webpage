        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p class="A1">In my travels I've thought about considering various career paths ranging from an array of industries. 
Coding by far made the most sense for me, this is due to the few select advantages coding possesses that not many industries can offer at this time
        </p>
            <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
            <p class="A2">Before the pandemic I was a dedicated musician. Every year I'd tour the UK performing in support of an established artist/band or I'd have my own UK or European tour.
                This yearly occurence wasnt to be this year and I wondered what industries had been affected the least. This is where my research lead me 
                to the world of coding and software development; And that's what led me to Code Nation
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p><b>My love for footy and music</b> helped take me across Europe from a young age. Being exposed to different environments on weekly basis really helped broaden my imagination and enable me to dream big. That along with having to engage in battle on the football pitch every week showed me alot about leadership, and what it takes to keep believing even in the face of defeat.</p>
            <p>My love for <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/" target="_blank">The Gunners</a> is endless as my family home is a stone throw away from the stadium so we can hear the crowd on a matchday. 
            Its tradition in my family to support Arsenal Football Club. My uncle was a professional footballer and was close to signing a contract with them in his days at Watford FC.
        I played professionally for Luton Town FC at schoolboy level but wasn't good enough to play in the mens team. As the door closed on my football career, music opened another one which kept me driven 
        and still wanting to be the best me I could be. As music became more of a priority I began writing songs for pop artists. A song I wrote made it on the FIFA21 soundtrack, and others have been in adverts and TV series's worldwide, racking up millions of streams in the process. As a solo artist I've been playlisted on BBC Radio1, CapitalXtra and performed at Glastonbury, Outlook Festival (Croatia), Rototom (Spain) and much more. Covid ruined my plans for music but software development and 
        the amazing <a href= "https://wearecodenation.com/" target="_blank">Code Nation team</a> have given me a new career to pursue on my eventful journey so far. I'm currently studying to be a level 2 Software engineer. I'm building in confidence and what I like in experience I'll surely make up with my winners mentality and team skills.</p>
