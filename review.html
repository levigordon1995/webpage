            <h2>Describing The Content And Layout For Each Page</h2>
            <p class="unit17">In my website I've opted for a yellow background which I feel stands out. I then decided to have a bold green text box with black writing as I feel the colours compliment each other.
                At that point I decided to organise my websites colour pallete with a Jamaican theme. I enforced this in the welcome page by adding a youtube link of one of my animated music videos which also has a Jamaican theme to it. 
            </p>

            <p class="unit21">On my unit 1 page I again kept to the Jamaican yellow and green theme but I had no youtube links so I alternated the colour of the text boxes so they pop up in a green then red format. Red, yellow and green are synonymous with Jamaican culture also so I thought it would work well witht the initial them
            </p>

            <p class="unit22">In my About me page I decided to use the text boxes as I have done in the pages prior but instead I decided to leave the last paragraph bare to give the user a break from the constant text boxes. I also decided to add links in the final paragraph giving the user a better understanding of what it is I was mentioning in the paragraph
            I also decided to use a shorcut icon image which is the Jamaica flag as I thought that would be a nice touch as it solidifies the look and theme I was going for. In the first Headline of all of every page I went for green text with a black wavy underline. I feel the underline represents the layed back island lifestyle. Most underlines are straight or doubled so I opted for something more suitable to the theme.
            Some would say the wavy underline could represent dreadlocs which is a focal part of Jamaican culture via the cultural movement of Rastafari.
            </p>

            <p class="unit21">In the Review page I kept things the same as I was simply relaying information about the website itself but I decided to edit the border outline to give the page less of a amateur look. When this was done I then decided to add the same effect to the whole website 


            <h2>1.5</h2>
                <p class="unit22">Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites The copyright law as well as other property laws affect websites as it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to avoid this is either, get permission from the original author or simply create your own content. If you want to publish information on your site from a different site, insert a reference link and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.
                If caught using other website's content it can drastically damage your search engine rankings, which can be harmful for online businesses. Other consequences of copyright infringement can be sentenced to 6 months jail time and/or a fine of up to Â£50,000, both convinced by the Magistrates' court.
                
           <h3>1.6</h3>
                <p class="unit21">Describing access issues that need considering there are multiple features to both apply and avoid when taking into consideration of possible user's disabilities when browsing your website. For example - before the prologue of a film is displayed a disclaimer, which by law must be added to ensure individuals are made aware that there may be flashing images. However, a website cannot offer the same feature so it would be mindful to restrict the use of flashing imagery when creating a web page for those who may suffer from epilepsy.
                Other features such as, for those who may need a visual aid, could be a magnifying effect. Such as highlighting a piece of content with the ability to zoom in on select items. This avoids the website having over-sized text which on average, would most likely have users click off the website entirely.
                There are many more additional features that could be added for those whom may not necessarily have a disability per se - but may need a blue light reduction, therefore a warmer filter could be added through a settings menu.
                
            <h4>1.7</h4>
                <p class="unit22">The appropriate file types for websites would be JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF, all of which contain a lossy or lossless compression as stated online. HTML is neccesary to create a webpage so thats imperative too</p>
