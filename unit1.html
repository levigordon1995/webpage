        <h1>Unit1</h1>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Unit 1.1|The Purpose Of IT in Modern Business</h2>
        <p class="unit1h">IT has become integral in the 21st century.</b> The purpose for IT in modern business is to communicate and conduct business in a faster, more efficient and reliable way.
            In the 20th century we would depend on fax machines and physical letters or we'd wait until business partners can meet in the flesh in order to conduct business but with new technology
            there are more innovative avenues to do such things. Email and Zoom are just two groundbreaking inventions that have allowed business to commence in places and circumstances it couldnt have in the 20th century
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>Unit 1.2|What do you need so that projects are successful</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
            <p class="unit12">In terms of tools, it is essential that if you are to be successful at working any project in modern business you need to have a mobile source of communication; be it a laptop or smart phone. This is needed as theres alot more competition in terms of businesses that are competing in each industry. Time is of the essence in business and creatives and innovators have caught on
            so now we have apps like Gmail, Zoom, Trello and Slack. All in which I reccomend at some point if your project is complex with a vast group of people who have differing roles and opinions. 
            In terms of skills, having strong communication skills are very important in the world business; more so in the tech business as one minor mistake could ruin an entire project as computers deal with matter of fact rather than opinion. So its essential that people working on big projects in the tech industry are precise and sharp with there use of Trello or Slack as clear definition of tasks is paramount</p>
            <br>
            <br>
    <h3>How will you plan it?</h3>
                <br>
                <br>
        <p class="unit135">In order to plan a project I would first conduct a Zoom meeting to discuss each team members role. Each role is defined so that we can go over our individual responsibilities with a sense of clarity. It is essential that we dont waste time taking on each others workload accidentally so a Trello is essential if we wish to be successful
        Here's an example of my Trello board. I feel this is very important because each member can edit there responsibilities so that everyone is updated without having to conduct another group meeting. Once this is done and everyones clear on there roles and ready to work; anyone 
        dealing with any difficulties can go to the Slack chat and reach out for help. This is good as the chat saves the thread so if that member or others are experiencing similar difficulties they can go back and refer to the chat as a guide. 
        </p>

        <h4>Unit 1.4| What causes digital projects to fail?</h4>
        <p class="unit14">When it boils down to digital projects, the fundamentals are particularly important. Making sure you have a charger present for both your smart phone and laptop is essential when working on digital projects as those are the main tools you will need in order to succeed. A plumber cannot work on your kitchen sink with his bare hands, he needs his tools at some point to get the job done; This is the same as anyone working on a digital project. So after you have made sure your digital devices are charged you will need to test them to make sure there aren’t any bugs or viruses that could hinder the speed of your progress in which you’d like to achieve when working on your digital project. This is very much essential with all digital devices but more so when it comes to laptops and computers as the user typically exposes them to sites and apps that possess a potent enough virus to crash your digital device. 
            Another aspect to consider when discussing failure in digital projects is Wi-fi connection. Being in the tech industry mid pandemic gives us an advantage as we can work remotely more so than others and achieve the exact same results all be it, we have our digital devices. Those results will be severely hindered if Wi-Fi connection is weak or you have none. 
            </p>
           <br>
           <br>
            <h5>Unit 1.5| How do you go about picking the right IT systems and software for the job?</h5>
            <p class="unit15">Firstly, you’ll need to establish the roles in which the job requires; and also figure out if it’s a job you could do yourself or one in which you need to break up into various roles. This is so that team members can work individually as a way of being time effective. Once the type of tools needed are distinguished, then we can go about picking the correct ones for the job. If I am working on a complex project with colleagues I haven’t worked with before, having a Trello board is essential as each member can monitor their own progress as well as oversee the progress of the whole project which brings clarity. However, if I am working on a project that is not complex and my group of colleagues are trustworthy in terms of capability and work rate then a WhatsApp group will suffice as they don’t need the structured format of Trello and Slack to understand where we are in terms of progress regarding the project. However, I would always use Trello to set tasks as the format is extremely helpful when setting tasks 
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
                <h6>Unit 1.6| How my chosen technologies helped me achieve my goals</h6>
                <p class="unit16">In previous projects I would conduct stand ups via Zoom as a way of problem solving whenever someone was struggling with a specific code or we needed clarity on something that we could not explain through text. The share screen option is helpful as all the team members were able to chime in and give their expertise on the matter. I would use Trello as a way of connecting each member role on the same page. It gave me a broader perspective of the project which is helpful as one can be very tied down to their own specific role which gives a lack of foresight when having to connect your role to one of another team member.
                </p>

                <br>
                    <h7 class="unit17h">Unit 1.7| How does GDPR affect digital projects?</h7>
                    <br>
                    <p class="unit17">GDPR also known as General Data Protection Regulation has helped even the score in terms of how much privacy an individual has when browsing the internet and using social media. Corporations and social media companies would exchange the personal data of there customers in order to gauge a clearer understanding of what promote or display to the customer. As the new age of the internet arose the rules and laws never caught up with the times until an adjustment to the Data Protection Act 2018 was made which gave any party involved in illegally accessing or exchanging personal data a hefty fine of 20 million pounds or a 4% deduction of the companies yearly turnover whichever is higher at the time. This now means anyone taking part in any digital projects that involve personal data has to make sure they follow the rules and the law precisely as it could ruin their entire business. This is good for the consumer as they can browse the internet freely compared to when this law wasn’t active. 
                    </p>
                    <h2>Unit 2.1| Am I happy with the tools used in my project?</h2>
                    <p class="unit21">I am incredibly pleased with the tools I used in my project. Slack and Visual code have run smoothly and the options you have within them both are vast and useful. 
                        In Visual code I can code in Python, HTML and CSS at the same time. I find that extremely helpful as each form of code is very much unique and has its own power but does not overlap. I find that very impressive as it is a hub for all my code. 
                        In terms of Slack and Trello, they both have been particularly useful as I can see what everyone is up to and how close they are to their goals. 
                    </p>
            
                    <h2>Unit 2.2| Were the tools appropriate?</h2>
                    <p class="unit22">I feel all tools were appropriate in this specific project besides Trello as I am working alone so the need to document what I haven’t done, what I’m doing and what is already done is quite excessive as I am a productive worker when alone. 
                        I also have a time constraint so updating my Trello regularly when having to get the done is seen as a chore if I feel I’m capable without it. However, it is something I will still use in future solo project 
                    </p>
            
                    <h3>Unit 2.3| Are you happy with your website?</h3>
                    <p class="unit234">Bearing in mind I had no knowledge of CSS or Html a week ago, I am pleased with how my website has ended up. I wasn’t sure how it would turn out but at the moment for my first attempt at creating a webpage with different functions and a design is something I feel I can be proud of. 
                        I could have made improvements though if given more time. I would have created animation that pops up whenever I hover the mouse over a button. I feel that would have added some authenticity but I’m still happy overall with my achievement as I’ve gained a transferrable skill that I can use in the tech business from now on.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Unit 2.4| Further Improvements</h4>
                    <p class="unit312">In terms of Improvements I would have made the colour of the background abit more custom made rather than it be generic. I also would have sounds that you hear anytime a button is pushed. It could have been a funny sound like cow mooing or just the sound of a computer mouse clicking</p>
                    
                    <h4>Unit 3.1| Review of benefits and drawbacks in IT</h4>
                    <p class="unit334">The befits when discussing IT tools are that there are tools for most specific needs. For example HTML helps lay out the blue print of what you're trying to convey whereas CSS allows you to customise and decorate what you wrote down in HTML.
                        The drawback of IT tools is that sometimes it can cause your computer/laptop to crash unexpectedly. This along with needing a baterry at all times to charge your laptop because it may die are the drawbacks of this.
                        Working in a team would have been amazing as each task would be fulfilling as you get to see the results straight away even if there are errors. This isn’t the case when working on Python as errors do not allow the coder to see what the finished product could look like. I would have enjoyed this project just as much as I have if it were team based
                    </p>

                    <h4>Unit 3.2| Could I have been more productive/efficient?</h4>
                    <p class="unit312">I feel I could have been more efficient in the time spent pondering what to write up and how I wanted to format my website instead of building a skeleton to work around that I can go back on and tweak while making my website look appealing. 
                        Procrastinating hindered my progress as I thought I was being productive as I was thinking about what to do before I done it but when the workload began to build I found myself playing a game of catch up in order to stay afloat which is not my style so in future I will start working on a template of what I think will work so that in future I don’t find myself in a similar position. 
                    </p>
            
                    <h5>Unit 3.3| Solutions to more productivity</h5>
                    <p class="unit334">I would have set myself a time limit to how long I work on my solo project as that would have given me incentive to get as much done as possible. 
                        I also would have made a Trello that combines my solo project with my life outside of work. For example I would post when I needed to prepare dinner or see family and what I would need to have that done by; that way any road blocks that emerge be it work or social life I can document and work around it. 
                    </p>
                    <h5>Unit 3.4| Testing </h5>
                    <p class="unit312">I would go about testing these methods by attempting them with other work projects and areas of social life I haven’t quite planned out so I can see how effective it is and how much I follow or stray away. I think it will help as I wouldn’t want to go against myself when I know I documented everything to stay productive.
                        I could also set alarms on my phone so I'm reminded of the duties I've brought upon myself
                    </p>
